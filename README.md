# SpaceForce-DataSearch
A tool to help scientists using satellite imagery of specific phenomena to find similar images to rapidly curate a dataset for scientific studies

Run `sh example.sh` to see the tool in action on the UC Merced land use dataset (to be reimplemented with DALI shortly)

To run it with your own data, please put your data in the following folder structure:
```
/Dataset
    /Class 1
        Image1.png
        Image2.png
    /Class 2
        Image3.png
        Image4.png
```
